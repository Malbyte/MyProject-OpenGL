TODO:

-redo movement surface collision, have collision based off of functions/arrays or some way to not have to put a bunch of if statements into movement 
(basically make it easier & cleaner to do wall collision!)

-for collision make function that can be called apon that will return a 1 for permittable movement and 0 
if collision.  it could possibly check an array of vertices of the hitboxes of entities.

-add textures to objects!

-add player physics of gravity outside of battle (like if you were in a platformer game instead of a ship in a bullet hell game)

-inputs switched over to glfw inputs to save space and make easier to read!
-have glew.dll be saved when programmed is installed inside the program x86 folder as a seperate folder (first have it checked if it is already installed with all the other prequisite libraries)

-try to get Drawarray function into GameFuncXtra.c instead of Main.c and have it work



-a star in a comment may usually mean to fact check the statement

-ProgramShadR is causing memory leak issues (FIXED ISSUE)

-new time based movement instead of frame based movement

-MULTIPLE THREADS!  this can allow for processing to be divided among the cores where one can handle drawing to screen, one can handle inputs, and one can handle calculations (one can also be used for a bunch of debugging purposes maybe even!)  just remember to not have that many threads, only a couple are needed (things that need to be run seperately/parallel for dramatic increased performance)

for adding health in a corner, we can have a couple of small squares where we can draw a heart with an invisible background

//use fread function to load shadersources
